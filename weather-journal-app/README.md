# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project consists of an async web app which uses Web API and user data for dynamically updating the UI from all the data fetched through the external OpenWeatherMap.com API and from  local API. 

## Instructions
- The `server/website/app` files are modified to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap.com API and post the User content to the local API via the route `http://localhost:3030/api`.

- The `index.html` are used for referencing elements, and styling using  `style.css`.

- Date, temperature and user content are used by dynamically updated UI on user click
